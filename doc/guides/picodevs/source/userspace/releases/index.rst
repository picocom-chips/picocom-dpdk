Release Notes
#############

.. comment We need to split the globbing of release notes to get the
   single-digit and double-digit subversions sorted correctly.  Specify
   names in normal order and use the :reversed: option to reverse it.
   This will get us through 10 subversions (0-9) before we need to
   update this list for two-digit subversions again.
